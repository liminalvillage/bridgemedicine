    "text": "Having seen many people with chronic pain and having dealt with chronic pain symptoms myself, I now wish to share what I have learnt and experienced. In Bridge medicine, I combine my experience as a Western pain physician with less conventional concepts (from a medical perspective) found in other fields and cultures. By this I mean concepts that have roots in shamanic and Eastern cultures like meditation, Jungian psychology, transgenerational integration, plant medicine and the intricate relationship between emotions and physical symptoms. I believe that by synthesizing different perspectives, they can combine holistically to paint a completed picture of the painful symptom or syndrome. By translating “foreign” concepts into our Western culture they also become more accessible, less esoteric to grasp, and can easier integrate in our daily lives. The only requisite is for the person who enters this process is that he or she is willing to heal and surrender to the transformative experience. I cannot promise a “quick fix” but with intentional effort there will be many \"rewards waiting on the other side of the bridge\". (This website is best viewed on your desktop)",
