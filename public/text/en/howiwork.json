    "text": "To book a consultation, you can contact me [here](mailto:bridgemedicina@gmail.com). I will contact you within 1-2 weeks to schedule an initial online consultation. This consultation is free of charge. First, I will evaluate if you might need (additional) medical consultation, in which case I'll advise you to contact your local GP or specialist. Secondly, we will explore together if I can help you in any way. If so, I will ask you to fill out an additional questionnaire (including your medical, family, lifestyle and social history) to get a broader perspective on your symptoms and overall health. We will then schedule a subsequent online session after that to begin our journey together. Every session will last around 60 minutes and costs 80 euro. Each session consists of the evaluation of physical and mental concerns and a guided meditation. Depending on your schedule these sessions can be weekly, or more sparse if desired. Please contact me [here](mailto:bridgemedicina@gmail.com) if you wish to propose a non-monetary exchange."
